    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">My Story</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      My name is Kevin, and like many others, I never expected my life to take the turns that it did. For years, I struggled with addiction and mental health challenges that seemed impossible to overcome. Drugs and alcohol became my escape, but they also became my prison.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      At one point, I suffered a stroke, and that changed everything. I realized how fragile life really is. Recovery wasn’t simple or fast — it was messy, painful, and full of setbacks. But every step forward, no matter how small, mattered.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      What I discovered is that healing isn’t about perfection. It’s about honesty, courage, and the willingness to keep trying even when you feel broken. Slowly, I began to rebuild: my health, my mind, and my spirit.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Whipper was born from this journey. It’s not just a website — it’s a space where others can find the support, tools, and community that I wish I had when I was at my lowest. Whether you’re in recovery, struggling with mental health, or just trying to improve your life, I want you to know that <strong>you are not alone</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my story — but Whipper is about <em>our</em> stories. Together, we can heal, grow, and support one another.
